# Optimal Schedule Maker for Foothill College Students
        Author: Mokhalad Aljuboori

To use this program, you need to input this command in the terminal: 
- `python -m pip install requests` to install requests

This is a remake of my C++ program: https://github.com/ogvenocity/Class-Schedule
but written in python and with a file, `coursefetch.py` so that you don't have to manually input the professor data.

coursefetch.py is used from: https://github.com/LordOfDeadbush/autoschedule/blob/main/coursefetch.py

This program is still a work in progress and will soon be a website. 

## TODO:
- Add error checking
- optimze `all_possible_schedules()` function
- add other scoring functions
- improve user interface
