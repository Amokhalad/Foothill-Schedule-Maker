# Optimal Schedule Maker for Foothill College Students
        Author: Mokhalad Aljuboori

This is a remake of my C++ program: https://github.com/ogvenocity/Class-Schedule
but written in python and with a file, `coursefetch.py` so that you don't have to manually input the professor data.

coursefetch.py is used from: https://github.com/LordOfDeadbush/autoschedule/blob/main/coursefetch.py

Warning: there might be some bugs still
## How To use:
- clone repository
- before you run main.py
- input in terminal: `python -m pip install requests` to install requests
- run main.py
- when it asks you to enter a course name: 
        - enter the dept followed by the course number, like: Math 1A, or math 1D, or phYs 4C, Engl 1A, etc.... (caps don't matter)

## TODO:
- Add error checking
- optimze `all_possible_schedules()` function
- add other scoring functions
- improve user interface
